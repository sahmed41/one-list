A portfolio in this context should represent a high-level container for multiple projects, with metadata for ownership, status, and timeframes.
​

Core properties
These cover identity, ownership, and lifecycle of a portfolio.
​

id: Unique identifier (e.g., Long id).
​

name: Human-readable portfolio name (e.g., “Marketing Q1 2026”).
​

description: Optional longer text describing goals and scope.
​

status: Enum like PLANNED, ACTIVE, ON_HOLD, COMPLETED, CANCELLED.
​

owner: Reference to a User or Account entity managing the portfolio.
​

startDate: Planned or actual start date.
​

endDate: Planned or target completion date.
​

progress: Computed percentage or health indicator (0–100 or enum).
​

projects: List<Project> or Set<Project> associated with this portfolio.
​

createdAt / updatedAt: Timestamps for auditing.
​

Optional but useful:

tags: List of strings for categorization (e.g., “OKR-2026”, “Internal”).
​

priority: Enum or numeric (e.g., LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL).
​

businessUnit / department: String or enum to group portfolios.
​

Domain methods (behavior)
These methods encapsulate business logic around projects and status, rather than just getters/setters.
​

addProject(Project project)

Adds a project to the portfolio and sets the portfolio reference in the project.
​

removeProject(Project project)

Removes a project while enforcing rules (e.g., prevent removal if not archived).
​

getProjectById(Long projectId)

Convenience lookup within the portfolio’s projects.
​

calculateProgress()

Aggregates project progress (e.g., average of project progress weighted by task counts) and updates progress.
​

updateStatus(PortfolioStatus newStatus)

Validates allowed transitions (e.g., cannot go from COMPLETED back to PLANNED without specific rules).
​

isActive() / isCompleted()

Convenience checks based on status and dates.
​

getActiveProjects() / getArchivedProjects()

Filters projects by their status inside this portfolio.
​

Service-level methods (in a PortfolioService)
These are not on the entity itself, but in a service that uses repositories.
​

createPortfolio(CreatePortfolioRequest dto)

updatePortfolio(Long id, UpdatePortfolioRequest dto)

archivePortfolio(Long id) (soft delete or status change).
​

getPortfolioSummary(Long id) (includes counts of projects and tasks per status).
​

listPortfoliosWithFilters(owner, status, dateRange) for dashboards.
​

If you describe how you want to calculate portfolio progress (e.g., based on task statuses of all projects), the next step can define an enum and exact Java method signatures.
